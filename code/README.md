Yellevate's top management has tasked us with solving five vital questions about their business. Obtain accurate and effective results with Microsoft Excel by relying on the powerful combination of Microsoft Excel and SQL. We are cleaning and manipulating the raw data to ensure accuracy and clarity. We are also creating a pivot table and chart analysis that will help us better understand the data. 

With the help of these five questions, we can help Yellevate's management make informed decisions that will improve their business. We can provide them with reliable data and insights that will help them develop effective strategies and tactics. 

1.) The invoice processing time is settled (average # of days rounded to a whole number).

2.) The processing time for the company to settle disputes (average # of days rounded to a whole number).

3.) Percentage of disputes received by the company that was lost (within two decimal places).

4.) Percentage of revenue lost from disputes (within two decimal places).

5.) The country where the company reached the highest losses from lost disputes (in USD).

Now, it's time for you to take action. Talk to someone else about this project and share what you're doing. The more people know about this, the more we can help Yellevate get the most out of its data-driven decisions. Let's work together to help get the job done right and help Yellevate succeed.
